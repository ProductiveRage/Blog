# Semantic Search Demo

This web app will read in the embeddings generated by the `GenerateSimilarityEmbeddings` project and allow you to search over the blog post data using the [e5-base-v2](https://huggingface.co/intfloat/e5-base-v2) semantic similarity model.

It uses a naive maximum distance threshold to try to discard results that are a poor match to the query, though this is not a reliable mechanism (it appears to do the job much of the time, but a reranker stage would be superior).

To try this out, run the `GenerateSimilarityEmbeddings` project first, as it will write cache files to its output folder - then you may run this project, as it will copy those cache files in order to provide the search (if you run this project without those files being available, you will receive see the message `Unknown Initialisation Error` in the web page).
