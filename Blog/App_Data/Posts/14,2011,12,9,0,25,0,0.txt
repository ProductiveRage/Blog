## Really??

"The under 25 crowd use a cell phone as their primary mode of accessing the Internet" - [http://www.tnrglobal.com/blog](http://www.tnrglobal.com/blog/2011/12/mobile-search-good-ux-means-fewer-touches-simple-design/).

Is this is a fact? I'm genuinely curious what this is based on. At 29 am I even older than I realised??
