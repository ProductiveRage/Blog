# Automated Similar Post Generator

Use the [Catalyst](https://github.com/curiosity-ai/catalyst) NuGet package to suggest similar posts (so that when I write a new blog post, I can run this and it may make suggestions of other posts to link to the new one and/or suggestions of existing "related posts" links that it might be better to update in light of the new post).

See my post about it here: [Automating "suggested / related posts" links for my blog posts](https://www.productiverage.com/automating-suggested-related-posts-links-for-my-blog-posts).
