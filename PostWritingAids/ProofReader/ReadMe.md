# Proof Reader

This was written when I realised how many spelling mistakes had slipped through the cracks over the years in my blog posts - the premise is to identify them and suggest corrections (potentially going as far as automatically correcting them in the future, pending a manual review before committing).

Challenges include the large technical vocabulary (which has many words not found in common English dictionaries) and the content of code samples (for the purposes of this, code samples are skipped entirely).
